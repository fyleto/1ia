# oneArray
1 indexed array. This wasn't my idea so don't kill me ðŸ˜­
I have a slight feeling this may become one of the most controversial packages out there.

# Install

```sh
npm i @fyleto/oneArray
yarn add @fyleto/oneArray
```
 # Use

 ```js
const oneArray = require("@fyleto/oneArray")

let a = new oneArray("hey", "how are you?", 239)

a.pos(1) // "hey"

a.set(3, 134) // sets element 3 (element 2 if you're a normal javascript user) to 134
```

I aplogize for my severe mistake
but then again, you are commiting to the joke.
